# BookBot

## Project Overview

BookBot is a command-line application built in Python that performs text analysis on classic novels like "Frankenstein". It reads a text file, counts the total number of words, and provides a detailed breakdown of how many times each character appears in the book.

This project was completed as part of the [boot.dev](https://boot.dev) "Build a BookBot" course. It serves as a practical introduction to building a professional development environment using Python, Git, and GitHub.
 
## Skills Demonstrated

 -   Basic Python programming (functions, loops, dictionaries)
 -   File I/O in Python
 -   Text processing and data analysis
 -   Structuring a multi-file Python project
 
## How to Run
 
 1.  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
 2.  Run the application from your terminal: python3 main.py

The script will analyze the text of "Frankenstein" located in the `books/` directory and print a report to the console.
